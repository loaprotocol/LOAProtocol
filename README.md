LOAProtocol
LOA (LOA-PROTOCOL) presents the direction for more practical utilization of cryptocurr￾encies. The cryptocurrency market is faced with the limitation to make it unable to sug￾gest any additional profit models apart from the realization of trading profits through the
actual trading. Some parties attempted the creation of profits by utilizing the mining sy￾stems but it was subject to the restrictions to prevent the guarantee of the stability of 
the invested fund and to allow only the low levels of return on investment. In order to o￾vercome these limitations of the cryptocurrency markets, LOA renders the services wh￾ereby the digital assets can be immediately used as the real currencies while assuring the
100% ownership on the digital assets. LOA has defined this system as C2C (Coiner to -
Coiner lending). C2C offers the deposit service (staking, wallets and others) as well as the
immediate loans secured by cryptocurrencies with support of the platform for investm￾ent and loan services between the individuals. Since this realizes the effect to have the 
value of digital assets recognized as the liquid assets, the utilization of the cryptocurre￾ncies can be maximized. 
Moreover, as the transactions for utilization of the cryptocurrencies are all executed thr￾ough the online channels, this often gives rise to formidable barriers to entry for the ver￾y elderly people and the beginners. With the aim to reduce these barriers to entry, LOA -
means to enhance the accessibility by introducing the concepts of investment and loans
which are most actively dealt with in the off-line financing. For the above reasons, we w￾ish to establish the foundation for the customers all over the world to utilize the crypto￾currencies in practical ways by providing the financing services to allow the use of the 
investment opportunities and loans secured by cryptocurrencies in safer and more rapi￾d ways under the connections established with the real-world economy on top of the 
P2P platform predicated on the blockchain technology.
